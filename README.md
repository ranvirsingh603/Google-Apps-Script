That's it! You've successfully assigned the "Sarpt" script, which will run when you open the sheet. ‚ú®

Now, you can add functionality to your Google Sheets using your custom script! üöÄ

# Google Apps Script - Custom Menu Creation

The following code demonstrates how to create a custom menu in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. This menu, named "Sum by Matharu," contains an item labeled "Sum," which is linked to the `sum` function. The code is designed to automatically execute when the Google Sheets document is opened.

##Code for making custom menu

```javascript
function onOpen() {
  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  ui.createMenu('Sum by Matharu')
      .addItem('Sum', 'sum')
      .addToUi();
}

```

### Explanation:

```
function onOpen() {

This line defines a JavaScript function named onOpen. It holds a special role in Google Apps Script as it is automatically triggered when you open your Google Sheets document.
```

```
var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
Here, we create a variable called ui and associate it with the user interface of Google Sheets. The SpreadsheetApp.getUi() function grants access to various user interface elements, such as menus and dialogs, within Google Sheets.
```

```
var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
The next line establishes a variable, ss, which represents the currently active spreadsheet. With SpreadsheetApp.getActive(), we gain the ability to manipulate the active spreadsheet programmatically.
```

```

ui.createMenu('Sum by Matharu')
Now, we embark on the creation of our custom menu. The code above generates a menu bearing the name "Sum by Matharu." We employ the ui.createMenu() method to fashion this novel menu.
```

```

.addItem('Sum', 'sum')
Within our custom menu, we add an item labeled "Sum." This item is linked to a function called sum. Clicking on this menu item will trigger the execution of the sum function.
```

```
.addToUi();
To complete our customization, this line adds the custom menu, complete with the "Sum" option, to the Google Sheets user interface. Now, when you open your Google Sheets document, you'll discover a fresh menu titled "Sum by Matharu" that offers the option to "Sum."
```

This script serves as a prime example of a common technique in Google Apps Script. It demonstrates how you can enhance Google Sheets by crafting custom menus, thereby enriching your spreadsheet's functionality and user experience.


This code represents a Google Apps Script function named `sum()`. Its purpose is to prompt the user for two input values, perform addition on them, and set the result as a formula in the current cell of a Google Sheets document.
##Code for making sum function

```javascript
function sum() {
 var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
 var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();

  var first = ui.prompt('First cell', ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);
 
  if (first.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.OK) {
   var first = first.getResponseText();
 } 
  
 var second = ui.prompt('second cell', ui.ButtonSet.OK_CANCEL);
  if (second.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.OK) {
  var second = second.getResponseText()
  }

    ss.getCurrentCell().setFormula('= '+first+' + '+second+'');
    var currentCell = ss.getCurrentCell();
    ss.getSelection().getNextDataRange(SpreadsheetApp.Direction.DOWN).activate();
    currentCell.activateAsCurrentCell();
     ss.getCurrentCell().copyTo(ss.getActiveRange(), SpreadsheetApp.CopyPasteType.PASTE_NORMAL, false);

}
```


## Function Details

- **Function Name:** `sum()`
- **Function Behavior:**
  - Retrieves the active spreadsheet and user interface of Google Sheets.
  - Prompts the user to enter a value for the first cell and stores the input in the `first` variable. The user's response is captured if they click the "OK" button; otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.
  - Prompts the user to enter a value for the second cell and stores the input in the `second` variable in a similar manner.
  - Sets a formula in the currently selected cell in the spreadsheet. The formula calculates the sum of the values entered by the user in the first and second prompts.

- **`ss`:** This variable represents the active spreadsheet. It's typically defined earlier in the script using a line similar to `var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();`. `ss` is crucial because it specifies the spreadsheet the script should operate on.

- **`getCurrentCell()`:** This method is called on the `ss` object. It retrieves the currently selected or active cell within the spreadsheet. In essence, it identifies the cell from which the copy operation originates.

- **`copyTo(destination, copyPasteType, transposed)`:** This method is called on the cell obtained using `getCurrentCell()`. It facilitates the copy operation and pastes the content into a designated destination within the spreadsheet.

  - **`destination`:** In this specific instance, it's `ss.getActiveRange()`. The `getActiveRange()` method retrieves the presently selected or active range (a group of cells) within the spreadsheet. So, `ss.getActiveRange()` signifies where the copied content will be pasted.

  - **`copyPasteType`:** This parameter specifies the type of copy-paste operation to be executed. In the code, it's set to `SpreadsheetApp.CopyPasteType.PASTE_NORMAL`, indicating a standard paste operation. Such an operation retains the formatting and values of the copied content.

  - **`transposed`:** This boolean value (true or false) determines whether the copied data should be transposed during the paste operation. Transposition involves switching rows and columns. In this code, it's set to `false`, meaning there is no transposition involved.

In summary, this code line copies content from the currently selected cell in the active spreadsheet, then pastes it into the active range within the same spreadsheet. The operation is a normal paste, preserving formatting and values, and no transposition is applied.

This script can be used to quickly perform addition in a Google Sheets document by prompting the user for the values to add and placing the result as a formula in the active cell.

Feel free to use and customize this script as needed for your Google Sheets automation tasks.
